# directory must be same as img01.png
# translation by 189j and multiplication by -1 was used to make the image reflect the example's position
# Y is the set of numbers from 0-188, as the image is 189 pixels tall
# X is the set of numbers from 0-165, as the image is 166 pixels across
# middle section uses cartesian product to construct a set of coordinates using the X and Y sets
